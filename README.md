# Medical-Billing-Prediction

# 🏥 Medical Billing Prediction – ML Regression Project

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict medical billing amounts based on patient, diagnosis, and hospital visit data using a synthetic dataset of 55,000+ records.

## 📊 Project Summary

- **Objective**: Predict billing amount from demographic and clinical features  
- **Dataset**: Synthetic healthcare dataset (55K+ rows)  
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (RMSE ≈ 13.8K)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- seaborn, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing (date handling, label encoding, length-of-stay feature)  
- ✅ EDA (distributions, correlation heatmap, pairplot)  
- ✅ Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- ✅ Model evaluation using R², MAE, RMSE  
- ✅ Visualization of predictions and feature importance
